This is the improved version of my last Todo app. It is a Single Page App, using jQuery to make the async calls using promises.
You can add a todo, mark it as complete, or delete one.

#### HOW TO USE #####

1) Clone or Download git repo
2) cd into the folder and run npm install
3) run node app.js
4) Open a broswer and go to localhost:3000
